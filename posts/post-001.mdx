# `git bisect`

Ever faced a situation where you made multiple commits to your project only to break a feature which you are sure it worked properly before you went on the commit spree?

How on earth do you even plan to begin debugging the code in such a scenario?

One could go on a brute force approach but wouldn't it be much easier(to debug) if git just tells you which commit messed up your feature?

`git bisect` does exactly that.

Suppose I have a commit history as shown below:

![Git Log](/post-001/img.d/1.png)

Lets say my feature worked properly in `29aa243`. I want to find which commit between `29aa243` and `d3bf6d2` broke my feature.

Before beginning to bisect the commits, lets get a basic understanding of the involved commands

#### To start bisecting, we run the command :

```sh
git bisect start
```

This would start a bisecting session where you have to test your feature and tell git if it works fine or is still broken.

```sh
git bisect good [optional commit] # If the feature works fine
git bisect bad  [optional commit] # If the feature is still broken
```

This is a simple logic graph of the process:

Now, We have to first initialize which commit is `good` and which is `bad` . In this scenario, my `d3bf6d2` (current HEAD) is bad and `29aa243` is good. Do this with the help of commands given above

![Git bisect](/post-001/img.d/3.png)

Now test your feature and subsequently go through the logic graph given above(**Note: It is very important that you donot begin to commit on the codebase in a Bisecting Session. Since the HEAD remains in a detached state in such session, it would give you a hard time fixing everything later. See the last part of this article on how to exit Bisecting Session**).

In the end of all revisions, git will tell which commit broke your feature :]

Now that you have found your guilty commit, its time to reattach your `Detached HEAD` back to `master`. Do this to reattach your detached HEAD

```bash
git bisect reset
```

Good luck with debugging that commit üëç.
