Weird title right? I know. This blog is not about focussing on some cool technology
or some random stuff I keep doing. Rather, this will be just a recap of things I did in
2022 and ofcourse its going to be very **informal** .

## The First quarterðŸš€(Jan - Mar)

This is I think the only period where I was chilled about my life AF. Things were going
so good(credit goes to online classes btw) that I had plently of time to just explore new things
and get into doing crazy shit(PS: Keep Reading to know more). Made new friends in college, _tried_
talking to [this girl ðŸ‘§](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) ([r/therewasanattempt](https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/)), 
late night (late enough to see next day's sunrise) skribbl games, online meets, movies et cetera.

I also distrohopped a lot in this period moving back and forth between Arch based and Debian based distros eventually settling
back to Arch. The sole reasons for my decisions are best represented by the following pie-chart:

But now I am getting old and lazy with no energy to maintain a system that requires more attention than any girlfriend on the planet.
Don't get wrong. Its stable(kind of) but only an Arch user would know the absolute horror
of running `pacman -Syu` after 3 months ðŸ˜¿. Its like sleeping in the maths class. The moment you wake up, you see things you have never seen before
and have no idea how it got there in the first place ðŸ’Š .

## The Great Transition âš¡(Apr - Sept).
The long awaited(or "un-awaited" for some ðŸ‘€) transition from online to offline class was now the reality. For the first time, I would
opening class notes to study curriculum. It was horrifying to study Engineering Drawing 8AM in the morning. How is it even remotely related to
"Computer Science" ðŸ˜µ ? This picture sums up my experience of EGD:

Also got into a bit of "Web Development" (something I was avoiding because I totally hated it). Every time I recall my decision to get into 
web dev, this is the only thing  that comes into mind:

Anyways, It was not **that** bad. Except for writing the css parts, it was decent. Also got into learning React and NextJS which I think abstracts
a **lot** of the things that happen under the hood. I mean, dont get me wrong. Those libraries were made for exactly that purpose but
still, playing with things that I dont know how they work internally, can be quite dangerous. For 23, I guess one of the main things
that I will be interested in will be internals of how these libraries work.

## 2nd year(Sept - Dec) ðŸ‘»

On paper, 3rd semester had some "interesting-looking" subjects. I will be honest. It was kind of decent. Atleast, this semester had courses
"related" to Computer Science. Nothing interesting happened in this period apart from the fact that 2022 was over just like that ðŸ˜¯.

Also, did I mention I am trying out Windows? I have been using a Linux distribution solely for the last 2-3 years. The things that stood out
immediately will be power management. I guess its just better hardware drivers and software optimisations but battery lasts a lot longer than
it did in Linux. One more thing that I noticed, Windows OEM that comes baked into a new laptop often has useless antivirus softwares(McAfee ðŸ‘€)
which makes it slow with annoying popups. Debloating is essential.

Enough fanboyingðŸ˜‚. Enjoy 2023.
