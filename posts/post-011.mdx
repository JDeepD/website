VPNs or Virtual Private Networks are a great way to secure your internet traffic and protect your privacy. 
They are also a great way to bypass geo-restrictions and access content that is not available in your country.

Lets build a VPN service using Wireguard on AWS EC2.

## What is Wireguard?
Wireguard is a modern VPN protocol that is fast, secure and easy to setup. You can read in detail about
Wireguard from [here](https://www.wireguard.com/#conceptual-overview). But in short, here is brief of how Wireguard
works:

1. There is a VPN server and clients(peers) that connect to it.
2. A pair of public-private keys are generated on the server and all its peers.
3. The server and peers exchange their public keys.
4. Thats it. The server and peers can now communicate with each other.

Well, there is more to it. But this is the basic idea.

On the VPN server, we need to do some configuration to allow the peers to connect to it.

An Example Server-Client Config looks like this:
```ini
# /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf : VPN Server
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.1/32
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = .... # Server Private Key

[Peer]
PublicKey = .... # Client Public Key
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
```

```ini
# /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf : VPN Client
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.2/32
PrivateKey = .... # Client Private Key
ListenPort = (random)

[Peer]
PublicKey = .... # Server Public Key
Endpoint = (server-ip):51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
```

Now, lets get an overview of how this setup works.

1. Lets assume the server IP address is 10.11.12.13.
2. Now, the client has to connect to it. So, it sends a packet to the server. The packet is created with
the source IP of the client(`10.0.0.2`), encrypted using the public of the server. Now this packet is sent to the configured endpoint of the server (i.e `10.11.12.13:51820`)
3. The server receives the packet and checks if the source IP is in the list of allowed IPs. If it is, then it decrypts the packet
and forwards it to the upper layers, else it drops the packet. Also, the server remembers the IP address(and port) of the client
when it receives the first packet from it.
4. Now, when the server has to send some response, it creates a packet with the source IP of the server(`10.0.0.1/32`) and encrypts
it using the public key of the peer. Now, since the client must have connected to the server before, therefore the server also knows the
endpoint(and port) for that peer. So, it sends the packet to the endpoint of the peer.
5. The client receives the packet and decrypts it. Checks if the source IP is in the list of allowed IPs. If it is, then it forwards
the packet to the upper layers, else it drops the packet.

## Hands On

1. Create an AWS EC2 instance (choose `t2.micro` if you don't want to pay anything). Make sure you have SSH access to it. I will be
using Amazon Linux AMI for this.
2. After creating your instance, go to security tab and allow ingress traffic on port 51820(UDP) from anywhere.
3. SSH into your instance.

```sh
# Install Wireguard
sudo dnf install wireguard-tools

# Generate Private and Public Keys(both in server and client) and store them in a file
wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
```
4. Next, configure wireguard configuration file: `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`
```ini
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.1/32 # Optional, If not specified, Wireguard will assign an IP address from the network interface for wireguard
PrivateKey = <server-private-key> # Replace with the private key of the server
ListenPort = 51820

# Replace <client-public-key> with the public key of the WireGuard client
[Peer]
PublicKey = <client-public-key> # Replace with the public key of the client
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32 # This is the IP address of the client in our VPN network
```

5. Next step is to create a network interface through which wireguard can send packets.

```sh
# Create a network interface
sudo ip link add dev wg0 type wireguard

# Assign an IP address to the network interface
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev wg0

# Enable the network interface
sudo ip link set up dev wg0
```

6. Confirm that `wg0` network interface is up using `ip -c a`.
7. Next In your client, create a similar configuration file with endpoint of the server and the public key of the server.

Once that is done, in the server route all IPv4 traffic through your wireguard interface.
```sh
# Enable IP forwarding
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# Set up firewall rules for traffic incoming on wireguard interface
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE  # Replace eth0 with your internet-facing interface
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

8. Now, start the wireguard service on the server and client.
```sh
sudo wg-quick up wg0

# Enable as a system daemon
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```
