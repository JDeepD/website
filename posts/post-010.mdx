What a year to unpack, sheesh. If there is one tech that dominated 2023, it has to
be LLMs. With GPT-4, we saw the first LLM that could write code. Later in the year,
we saw Gemini by Google, [which later turned out to be a gimmick](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/googles-best-gemini-demo-was-faked/).
Still, the pace at which LLMs are improving is astounding.

College is back with 6-month semesters. 5th semester has to be the best one till now, academically.
Not that I aced it but it was fun. All(except Software Engineering) the subjects were interesting and 
I got to learn a lot. 
```
Speaking of Software Engineering, I think it's the most 
useless subject in the entire curriculum. I mean, I get it, 
it's important to learn  about the software development process
but the way it's taught is just so bad. It's like they are trying 
to make it as boring as possible.

Anyways, this _random meme from the internet_ exactly describes how I felt about this semester.

Oh yeah, NextJS 14 was released. Needless to say, It was orgasmic.
Server Actions? Muuaah. Absolute Beauty. Also, I will give Svelte
a try in 2024 cuz of all the hype.

Biggest regret of 2023? Not being able to learn a new language. Let's 
be honest, you can't be the cool dude until you dabble in a niche language
like Rust, Haskell or Elixer.

Anyways, I thought about doing a section on all the interesting
tech/tools I found this year. I'll try to keep it short and sweet.

1. [Quick Lint JS](https://github.com/quick-lint/quick-lint-js) 
2. [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
3. [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/)
4. [Usehooks](https://usehooks.com/)
5. [Remotion](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion)
6. [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)
7. [Modern Unix](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix)

Let's talk about the elephant in the room. I didn't write a lot this year.
Well, I did write a lot but I didn't publish it. I have a lot of drafts but they
are unpolished and I don't feel like publishing them. I'll try to publish more in 2024.

Also, I used a lot of Windows this year. I know, I know, I'm a traitor. But I had to
use it for college. Besides, it's not that bad. I mean, it's bad but not _that_ bad.

I don't know how many of you even read my blog. I am too caught up to put Google Analytics in it.
But still, I would love to hear your feedback. You can reach out to me on [Email](mailto:jdeepd.dev@gmail.com).

That's it for this year. Hope you guys have a great 2024.ðŸ‘‹
