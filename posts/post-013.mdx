CORS is one of the most common issues with APIs in general.

Browsers have a security feature called `Same-Origin` Policy. This policy prevents a web page from making requests to a 
different domain than the one that served the web page. 
This is a security feature to prevent [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises/csrf) attacks.

TLDR, CSRF is an attack where a malicious website sends a request to a different website on behalf of the user.

Basically, Forging a request and sending it on behalf of the user to the server. (It's more prevelant than you think).

To protect against CSRF attacks, the browser implements the `Same-Origin` policy.

`Origin` is defined as the combination of `protocol`, `host`, and `port`.
If the `Origin` of the request and the `Origin` of the response are the same, the browser allows the request.

For example, 

| Same Origin?                | http://example.com/foo              | http://example.com/bar              | https://example.com/foo            | https://www.example.com/foo         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| http://example.com/foo      | Yes (Same protocol, host and port)  | Yes (Same protocol, host and port)  | No. Protocol is different          | No. Protocol and Host are different |
| http://example.com/bar      | Yes (Same protocol, host and port)  | Yes (Same protocol, host and port)  | No. Protocol is different          | No. Protocol and Host are different |
| https://example.com/foo     | No. Protocol is different.          | No. Protocol is different           | Yes (Same protocol, host and port) | No. Host is different               |
| https://www.example.com/foo | No. Protocol and Host are different | No. Protocol and Host are different | No. Host is different              | Yes (Same protocol, host and port)  |


Now suppose the frontend has to make a request to the backend at `https://api.example.com/` and frontend is hosted
at `https://www.example.com/`. When you invoke the `fetch` API of the browser, here is what happens:

1. The browser before sending the actual request to the server, sends a `preflight` request to the server.
2. A [preflight request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request) is an HTTP OPTIONS request
([OPTIONS method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS) is just like other HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT). But
it is sent to the server primarily to ask if the server actually allows the original request to be sent.

An OPTIONS request has the following headers:

```http
OPTIONS /profile/post/ HTTP/1.1
Host: https://api.example.com
...
Origin: https://www.example.com
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type
```

The `OPTIONS` request asks the server if it allows the `POST` request from `https://www.example.com` with the header `Content-Type`.

The server responds with the following headers:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache/2.0.61 (Unix)
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
...
```

Here, in the preflight response, the server says that it allows the `POST`(along with `GET` and `OPTIONS`) request from `https://www.example.com` with the header `Content-Type`.

If the server does not respond with the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, 
the browser will not send the actual request to the server and you will see the following error in the console:

> Access to fetch at 'https://api.example.com/profile/post' from origin 
'https://www.example.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't 
pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. 

Therefore, the server has to respond with the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header for the `OPTIONS` request to allow the actual request
to be made to the server.

If you are Javascript developer, you might have used the [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors/) package in Node.js to enable CORS. This library abstracts
out a lot of these `OPTIONS` request handling for you. While abstraction is good, but using this library without understanding
CORS can lead to a lot of confusion.

### Quick Note on expressjs-cors middleware

The `cors` middleware in expressjs is used to enable CORS in the server. It is used generally as follows:

```javascript
...
const corsOptions = {
  origin: ,
  credentials: ,
}
app.use(cors(corsOptions));
...
```

1. The origin parameter is used to specify the origin from which the server allows requests. If you set it to `*`, it allows requests from all origins (**There is gotcha though**). You can
also set it to a specific origin like `https://www.example.com` or to a regular expression to match multiple origins or to an array of
allowed origins or to `true` which basically sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the `Origin` of the request (virtually same
as setting it to "*").
2. The credentials parameter is used to specify if the server allows credentials to be sent with the request. If you set it to `true`, the server will respond with the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header set to `true`.
Credentials are cookies, TLS client certificates, or authentication headers containing a username and password. By default, these credentials are not sent in cross-origin requests, and doing so can make a site vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

** The gotcha with setting the `origin` to `*` is that you cannot set the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to `true`. 
If you do, the browser will not allow the request. Therefore, if you have to send credentials with the request, 
you have to set the `origin` to a specific origin and set the `credentials` to `true. 

If you do want to allow requests from all origins and also send credentials, you have to set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the `Origin` of the request in the server.
This is simply done by setting the `origin` to `true` in the `cors` middleware.
