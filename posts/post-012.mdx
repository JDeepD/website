title: How I took down GDSC Website - A DNS Nightmare

**Some context** : I am in the Cloud Core Team of GDSC NIT Silchar and I am responsible 
for maintaining the domains and making sure that [gdscnits.in](https://gdscnits.in) is up.

**29th January 2024, 1:10 AM** : I receive a text that `gdscnits.in` is down. (I kind of knew instantly what might have caused it, keep reading further.)

I checked `gdscnits.in` in my browser and it was indeed down. Checked the DNS Status and Oh Boy I was fucked:

</div>

**Some more context** : We bought `gdscnits.in` from GoDaddy but we externally manage the DNS records for it on Netlify (because it has a cooler UI, so why not, right?)

I went to Netlify and everything looked perfect. There was nothing out of ordinary. Got `NETLIFY` and `NETLIFYv6` records pointed to `gdscnits.netlify.app`.

You must be wondering, what the hell is `NETLIFY` and `NETLIFYv6` records. Well I was confused too and I didn't pay attention to it until now.

DNS records are of many types. 2 most common ones are `A` records and `CNAME` records.

`A` records: Maps Domain name to IPv4 Address

`CNAME` records: Maps Domain name to Domain Name

So where does `NETLIFY` record fit in it? Well, `NETLIFY` record is special type of record in Netlify DNS. It will return
the IP address of the closest CDN node based on the IP address of the system making the DNS lookup. In short it returns an IP
address but it may not be the same IP address always. It will depend on the location of the system making the DNS lookup.

Well, **what if** on top of the `NETLIFY` record, you have a `CNAME` record pointing to the same domain name? 
The domain name indeed resolves to the value of `CNAME` record **but but but**, we cannot load the website.
(I am yet to figure out why it doesnâ€™t resolve).

But I saw that in our DNS records and deleted the `NETLIFY` records(and kept the `CNAME` record). Website is still down.

For the next 2 hours, I tried all permutations and combinations of DNS records like a sheep desperately trying to get
the site up before dawn and act like nothing ever happened. But I failed miserably.

The last resort was to nuke everything and start from scratch. I deleted all the DNS records, changed the nameservers
back to GoDaddy's default NS and deleted the domain from Netlify.

Added Netlify's NS back to GoDaddy and added the domain back to Netlify. It worked. Thank God!(It was almost 3AM by that time.)

**Remember I said I kind of knew what might have caused the problem?**. Well that very same day, I was showing a bunch of juniors
setting up and managing domains on Netlify. I wanted to create an `A` record for `xyz.gdscnits.in` pointing to some IP address.
I forgot to add `xyz` to the sub-domain name and created an `A` record for `gdscnits.in` pointing to that IP address. I immediately realized
the mistake and deleted the record. But I guess it was too late.

**Lesson Learned** : Never mess with DNS records when you are sleepy. You will end up messing up everything.
