Now it isn't new when you deploy your code and it fails miserably on your expections.
Maybe it is a bit sluggish, or perhaps it just doesn't work as it used to (in localhost).

Now there are many different developers in this world but this blog mainly focusses on those
who are going to be unemployed first when AI takes over: `The Web Developers`.

Like most Web Devs, you probably use JavascriptðŸ¤¡ or the fancier TypescriptðŸ‘º.
If your JavaScript was a relationship, itâ€™d be the kind that starts out exciting but quickly becomes 
overwhelming, exhausting, and, ultimately, unsustainable. God I just look back into my past projects
and I absolutely clueless what I wrote.

In this blog, I will give you blue pill. The pill of eternal sustainability. The pill which will not fail.

1. TS in good. You will love it once you know how to use it properly. But it's a phase. Much like chainsmokers
start off with Indie Mint or Mixpod but later acknowledges that Gold Flake, Neo and Advance are really the ones.
Once you pass that phase, you would realise JS is the only thing that matters.

    <img src="/post-015/meme1.jpeg" alt="Meme for you" width="90%"/>
</div>

2. GenAI and LLMs. Your time is too valuable to spend on writing useless boilerplates. Learn when to offload your
work to LLMs so that you can focus on solving the actual problem! Also, here are some absolutely useless AI tools for developers:
[Phind](https://www.phind.com/search?home=true), [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), [You](https://you.com/).

3. Learn [Touch Typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing) and [Vim](https://neovim.io/)! Can't stress this enough. It's going to 2x your productivity.
Besides, all that Keyboard knowledge won't fail ____, yk.

4. Watch good people. Youtube & Twitch are a gem. Some of the ones I follow are: [H3Vtux](https://www.youtube.com/@H3Vtux/videos), [BaBD](https://www.youtube.com/@BeABetterDev),
[Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater), [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/@bawad), [Piyush Garg](https://www.youtube.com/@piyushgargdev),
[CompSciGuy](https://www.youtube.com/@MrCompSciGuy) and [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile)

5. Be a [Pi-Shaped Learner](https://web.appunite.com/blog/become-a-pi-shaped-developer)
