A different kind of blog from what I generally write.

To be honest, I'm failing at everything. 
I'm not doing well at class, I'm not doing well at career, I'm not doing well at relationships,
I'm not doing well at anything.
I'm just failing at everything. I'm not sure what to do about it. 
I'm just not good enough. I'm not sure what to do about it.
I'm not sure how to be the person I want to be.

People have this innate desire to be successful. But not everyone is successful. Some people are just not good enough.
No matter how much you are the MC of your own life, you can't always be the hero. You might very well be an NPC in everyone else's life.

To be honest I am not sure why I am even writing this blog. I just want to write out everything that I'm feeling. I'm not sure if it's going to help me or not.

Till this point, I have always told myself that whatever happens, it happens for good. But I'm not sure if that's true anymore.
If only I could see the future to know if it's worth it to keep going. But I don't have ability either. I don't know where is the
finish line and I don't know if I'm even on right track. Is there even a finish line? 

Every passing day, I'm just getting more and more tired and exhausted. It's getting miserable.

A test of time? Sure. I get it.
